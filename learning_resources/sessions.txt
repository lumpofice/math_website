For each user, Flask creates a dictionary called session, storing key value pairs specific to the user through a cookie that has been cryptographically signed using the configured SECRET_KEY in our application's configuration file. This is an important point for the user as they move from one point to another our application. POST requests have access to the data a user enters for the duration of the request, but session has access to the data from request to request. So, after we implement a POST/Redirect/GET pattern---this is a pattern used to obviate the undesirable outcome of form data being submitted multiple times as the user refreshes their browser---the session dictionary is what must be accessed to retrieve data previously entered by the user.
