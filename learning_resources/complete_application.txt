This document serves to cover the basics of creating a functioning Flask application.

1) We use app = Flask(__name__) in the __init__.py file to create the application instance, with the __name__ variable being used to determine the root path of the application for Flask's reference.

2) The client communicates with the web server via the "request", and Flask uses the route mapping, which has been generated as a set of links between a request-specific URL and a view functions's decorator, which registers that function as the event-specific handler, to run the code corresponding with the request.

3) To run the application through Flask's launched integrated development web server
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Here is an example of a complete application:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return <h1>Hello</h1>

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
