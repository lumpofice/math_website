When setting up our database, we use the Flask wrapper for SQLAlchemy, Flask-SQLAlchemy, which is an object-relational mapper with optional access to the low-level SQL code. The database we will use is SQLite. The columns for our tables will correspond with the Python attributes used in the setup definition, which includes the datatype and whether or not the attribute is to serve as a primary key; whether or not the attribute will serve as a unique value; and whether or not we are to assign to it an index.
