v3.0.0
------

Major version bump as this version removes support for Python 3.5 and 3.6, along with multiple
major breaking changes. Hope you've been following SemVer :)

- Dropped support for end-of-life Python 3.5 and 3.6, added tests for 3.10 and 3.11.
- Fixes to documentation to address outdated links and settings (#204, 201)
- Jinja version 3 or greater is now required (released 2021)
- Removed Babel._date_formats, use the public Babel.date_formats instead.
- list_translations() always returns the default locale, even if it does not exist. (#75)
- Add lazy_npgettext() (#68)
- Babel.locale_selector and Babel.timezone_selector no longer exist. They must be provided
  either when the Babel() object is created or when init_app() is called. This is to support
  having a single Babel object for multiple Flask apps (#107) as well as to simplify settings
  and multi-threaded state.
- Most configuration options can be passed directly through init_app().
