	<!-- With the novalidate attribute, the form tag informs 
the browser that form data will be validated elsewhere. This prevents
the appearance of error messages generated by the form, as well as 
allowing flask to handle all form validation matters. The action="" 
will resolve to the current webpage's address. The method="post" 
attribute will send data entered into the form to the server to be 
stored. This particular method is secure, storing no data into a 
browser URL, which does happen in the format of name/value pairs, 
with method="get" -->

	by the server side using the secret key written
	into the config.py file, is one such hidden field. -->
