			<p id="text">Some companies sell their butter products by the box. Whether it be a box of 4 4oz packages of butter, or a box of 8 2oz packages of butter, the company sells that butter in the same size box. Conceivably, the company could sell that box as 1 16oz block of butter or 16 1oz packages of butter; they could sell it as a combination 4 2oz and 2 4oz packages; they could sell it as a combination of 14 1oz and 1 2oz package; any sizing and numbering combination of packages. In any of these scenarios, that entire block of butter represents the "space" of 100% of the purchased butter. A concept in mathemtics, consisting of breaking down 100% of a material contained within a given space to <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">every possible</span></em> package of some arbitrary size within that space, is what we aim to tackle below. Of course, what we will ultimately be dealing with is a space of numbers, but we can begin to think about this concept using something maleable like butter.</p> 
			<p id="text">Let's emphasize again the words <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">every</span></em> and <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">possible</span></em> within the phrase:</p>

			<p id="text">Breaking down 100% of the butter contained within its box to <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">every possible</span></em> stick of butter of some arbitrary size may be physically impossible. Here are two examples of what is physically possible:</p>

Currently, our "space"&mdash;box&mdash;of material has been broken down to several smaller "subsets"&mdash;packages&mdash;of multiple fixed sizes, with each subset being contained within the larger space. But is our space broken down to <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">every possible</span></em> subset of some arbitrary size? Would you agree that we could draw other subsets of different sizes anywhere within our larger space, even if there is overlap between them and the already existing subsets?</p>

			<p id="text">Sticks of butter deviate from the typical exposition of the metric topology. The squares, however, correspond to a specific metric falling under the general form of this concept we call Metric Topology. To properly dive into this concept, we need an understanding of a few additional items.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='topic'>	
			<h3>Topology</h3>
			<p id="text">A topology on a space, say \(\mathbb{X}\), is a collection, say \(\tau\), of elements of \(\mathbb{X}\) that follows three rules</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">i) Both \(\mathbb{X}\) and \(\emptyset\) belong to \(\tau\)</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">ii) The union of any collection of elements of \(\tau\) belongs to \(\tau\)</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">iii) The intersection of any finite collection of elements of \(\tau\) belongs to \(\tau\)</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">Let's take a few moments to clear some things up:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; The symbol \(\emptyset\) is called the empty set. We will see this in math often enough, and it is meant to communicate that there is no element from the collection \(\tau\) present. If elements from the larger collection \(\tau\) were placed inside of boxes, think about the box containing the empty set as being&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;empty.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; Think about a union as a combining of several boxes of elements into a single, larger box. Here is a formal definition:</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">$$\text{A}\cup\text{B} = \{x \hspace{4pt} : \hspace{4pt} x \in A \hspace{4pt} \text{or} \hspace{4pt} x \in B\}$$</p>
			<p id="text">This mathematical statement, translated to English, reads: \(A\) union \(B\) is the set&mdash;open curly brace&mdash;of all objects \(x\) such that&mdash;the first \(x\) followed by the colon&mdash;\(x\) belongs to set \(A\) or \(x\) belongs to set \(B\)&mdash;the smooth-backed, e-shaped symbol is shorthand for the phrase "belongs to"&mdash;and we finally close the set with a second curly brace. The definition is not limited to two sets&mdash;the number of sets could be infinite, actually. For instance, think about that coffee mug, filled with the several-years' collection of purchased/borrowed/stolen pencils and pens, sitting on your work station. It use to be the case that those pencils and pens belonged to their own respective packaging; you might have even known which writing utensil came which package. Now-a-days, when you reach for one of those writing utensils, it could have come from package \(A\) or package \(B\) or package \(C\) or ... We really don't need to worry about more than two sets in this discussion, however&mdash;that is a story for a different webpage. Here is a visual to help demonstrate the idea of a union of objects from two sets \(A\) and \(B\).</p>
			<div id='union'>
				<p id="text">Press the button to see an example of a union.</p>
				<button id='union_button'>Press to union</button>
			</div>
			<p id="text">The first thing we need to notice is that sets \(A\) and \(B\) both contain three elements: circles of different radii&mdash;these circles represent something precise in the context of the metric topology; we will discuss this later. Set \(A\) contains a circle of radius 15, one of radius 20, and one of radius 25, while set \(B\) contains a circle of radius 18, one of radius 23, and one of radius 28. Notice that all of the elements from set \(A\) and set \(B\) are present in set \(C\) when we take the union of sets \(A\) and \(B\)&mdash;when you press the button. This union of \(A\) and \(B\) is represented as \(A \cup B\). As stated in the formal definition, to choose an object from set \(A \cup B\) means choosing an object that is contained within either \(A\) or \(B\). If both sets \(A\) and \(B\) are members of topology \(\tau\), then by part ii) in the definition of a topology, we have the set \(A \cup B = C\) is a member of \(\tau\).</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; Think about an intersection as a box that contains only the elements that are present in every box under consideration. Here is the formal definition:</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">$$\text{A}\cap\text{B} = \{x \hspace{4pt} : \hspace{4pt} x \in \text{A} \hspace{4pt} \text{and} \hspace{4pt} x \in \text{B} \}$$</p>
			<p id="text">In English, this statement says that the intersection of \(A\) with \(B\) is the collection of all objects such that those objects appear in both \(A\) and \(B\). Consider the coworker who retrieves the pens they allow others to borrow. Actually, imagine that this coworker designates a special collection of pens for such a purpose&mdash;this coworker might even be paying enough attention to know exactly who in the office has handled each of these pens! For the sake of simplicity, imagine only two coworkers, Coworker \(A\) and Coworker \(B\), have bothered to borrow a pen from amongst those in the current collection&mdash;say, 11 pens total; some borrowed by Coworker \(A\); some by Coworker \(B\). If, within this collection, there are 3 pens that both Coworker \(A\) and Coworker \(B\) have borrowed, then there are only 3 pens that have been handled by both Coworker \(A\) and Coworker \(B\), while the other 8 pens have been handled by either only Coworker \(A\) or by only Coworker \(B\). Again, we are not limited to only two sets when dealing with such a concept, but there is no need to invite further headache for this discussion. Here is a visual to help communicate the idea of the intersection of two sets:</p>
			<div id='intersection'>
				<p id="text">Press the button to see an example of an intersection.</p>
				<button id='intersection_button'>Press to intersect</button>
			</div>
			<div id='subset'>
				<p id="text">You might have noticed the size of the box for the union is larger than either of the two sets whose elements comprise the union; the size of the box for the intersection is smaller than either of the two sets whose elements comprise the intersection. The next concept can now better be framed with these size differences in mind. When each member of one set appears within another set, we have what is mathematically referred to a a subset&mdash;yes, you've seen this word before! Remember those sticks of butter from earlier? Each stick of butter is a subset of the larger block of butter. Every time you pressed the buttons above, generating a new square within the larger square with each press, a new subset was drawn within the larger square. Let's look at a formal definition.</p>

			<h3>Basis for a Topology</h3>
			<p id="text">A collection \(\mathcal{B}\) of subsets of \(\mathbb{X}\) is a basis for a topology \(\tau\) on \(\mathbb{X}\) if </p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">i) For each element in \(\mathbb{X}\), there exists a \(B\) in \(\mathcal{B}\) containing that element.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">ii) If for any element in \(\mathbb{X}\) we have two subsets \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) from the collection \(\mathcal{B}\) containing that element, then there is a \(B_{3}\) in \(\mathcal{B}\) that also contains that element such that
					$$B_{3} \subset B_{1} \cap B_{2}$$
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">Remember the points for each face of a stick of butter extending out of view and into our screens discussed above? Assume that a collection of sticks of butter serves as a basis for the topology on the larger block of butter&mdash;still with me? Think about the two conditions for basis of a topology like this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">i) For each molecule of butter in the larger block of butter, there exists a stick of butter within the block containing that molecule&mdash;think about the points of the faces for those sticks of butter.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">ii) If for any molecule of butter, let's call it \(z\), within the larger block of butter, there exists two possible sticks of butter that both contain that molecule, there must be a third stick of butter contained within their overlap that also contains that molecule (see the figure below).   
				</li>
			</ul>
			<div id='basis_set_3'></div>
			<p id="text">We can define a topology, \(\tau\), generated by a basis, \(\mathcal{B}\), as a collection of subsets of the space, \(\mathbb{X}\), with each subset, \(U\), considered open if, for every element within \(U\), there is a basis, \(B\), that contains that element and if \(B\) is contained within \(U\).</p> 
			<p id="text">Let \(B\) be the basis element, let \(U\) be the subset that is open in space \(\mathbb{X}\), and let little \(z\) be the element within \(U\) that is contained within basis element \(B\). The graphic below roughly illustrates the idea.</p>
			<div id='basis_in_open_set'></div>
			<p id="text">This means: if, for every element inside of the set \(U\), we can wrap a basis element around that element such that the basis element is contained within the boundary of set \(U\), then \(U\) is open.</p> 
			<p id="text">When a space \(\mathbb{X}\) can be fashioned with a metric, which we can think of as a measuring device, then we can also <em><span style="color: #6b4691; font-weight: bold;">think of a set, \(U\), in a topology on \(\mathbb{X}\) as being open if there is some measurable distance between the boundary of the set and any element within it.</span></em></p>
			<p id="text">Examples of metrics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; the euclidean metric, which gives rise to the circle shapes we see in this discussion;</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; the square metric, which gives rise to the square shapes we see in this discussion;</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">We will be using the symbol \(d\) to denote the function known as a metric in the definition of a metric that follows.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='topic'>	
			<h3>Metric</h3>
			<p id="text">A metric on a set \(\mathbb{X}\) is a real-valued function. Think of the measure of distance between you and me. There are four things that must be true about the distance between you and me before the device used to measure that distance can be labeled as a metric. I will label myself as \(x\) and you as \(y\). The metric will be labeled as \(d\). Oh, and we will need a friend of yours, \(z\), to help us out.</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">i) \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, y) \geq 0 \hspace{10pt}\) Okay this one makes sense, right? There is always some non-negative distance between two objects.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">ii) \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, y) = 0 \hspace{10pt}\) when \(\hspace{10pt} x = y \hspace{10pt}\) This too makes sense, for there is only one way for the distance between the two of us to be zero: I am you.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">iii) \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, y) = d(y, x) \hspace{10pt}\) which means that the distance from you to me is the same the distance from me to you. Okay, so far everything is making sense.</li>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">iv) \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) \hspace{10pt}\) Maybe we should discuss this one a bit further.
			</ul>
			<p id="text">Actually, it's not too bad. We know \(d(x, z)\) to mean the distance between your friend and me. There is some straight line between us, which is the shortest distance from me to them. You, \(y\), may or may not lie along that straight line between myself and your friend. If you do, then the equality portion of the inequality holds. Meaning,</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, z) = d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</li>
			</ul> 
			<p id="text">If not, then the path from me to you, \(d(x, y)\), plus the path from you to them, \(d(y, z)\), is longer than the straight line from me to them, \(d(x, z)\), and thus, the inequality portion of the inequality holds. Meaning,</p>
			<ul>
				<li class="topdown_list" id="text">&#8226; \(\hspace{4pt} d(x, z) \lt d(x, y) + d(y, z)\)</li>
			</ul>
			<p id="text">As mentioned above, a metric is a measuring device, and it can be used to show that, for a space \(\mathbb{X}\) fashioned with a metric, there is distance between the boundary of an open set, \(U\), and any point within that set, assuming the set is open. We will need an object called an epsilon ball to help us with this task. Epsilon is a Greek letter, \(\epsilon\), and an epsilon ball is a set of elements that all lie within some distance, epsilon, referred to as the radius of the epsilon ball, of one another. The center of an epsilon ball is one point in open set \(U\) from which we wish to show the existence of a non-zero distance to the boundary of \(U\). Let \(\hspace{2pt} y \hspace{2pt}\) be in the open set \(U\). Since \(U\) is open, there exists a basis element, \(B_{d}(x)\), that contains \(\hspace{2pt} y \hspace{2pt}\) and is a subset of \(U\). This basis element, \(B_{d}(x)\), is an epsilon ball, with a center point, \(x\), and radius, \(d\). We give it the subscript and radius \(d\) so as to distinguish it from the epsilon ball, \(B_{e}(y)\), that will be centered at our chosen point, \(y\). Our job is to use the metric to show that there exists an epsilon ball that is centered at \(\hspace{2pt} y \hspace{2pt}\) and contained in \(U\).</p> 
			<div id='boundary_distance'></div>
			<p id="text">Let's focus on the epsilon ball with radius \(d\). Visually, we can draw another epsilon ball, \(B_{e}(y)\), of radius, \(e\), around our element, \(y\), such that \(\hspace{2pt} y \hspace{2pt}\) is the center of that ball and the ball is contained in the epsilon ball, \(B_{d}(x)\), and thus is also contained in \(U\). But we need to show this, mathematically. This can be done by showing that the distance between any element, \(z\), in \(B_{e}(y)\) is less than \(d\), which is the distance between \(x\) and the boundary of \(B_{d}(x)\). Why will this suffice? The goal is to show that \(B_{e}(y)\) is an epsilon ball with center \(\hspace{2pt} y \hspace{2pt}\) and contained in \(U\). Since \(B_{d}(x) \subset U\), if we can show \(B_{e}(y) \subset B_{d}(x)\), then we deduce that \(B_{e}(y) \subset U\).</p>
			<div id='epsilon_ball'></div>
			<p id="text">Let \(e = d - d(x, y)\). We have that \(d(x, y) \hspace{4pt}\)&lt;\(\hspace{4pt} d\). So, when \(z\) is an element in \(B_{e}(y)\), we have</p>
			<p id="text">\(d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z) \hspace{4pt}\)&lt;\(\hspace{4pt} d(x, y) + e = d(x, y) + (d - d(x, y)) = d\)</p>
			<p id="text">In summary, we have \(d(x, z) \hspace{4pt}\)&lt;\(\hspace{4pt} d\).</p>
			<p id="text">Since \(z\) was chosen arbitrarily, we know that this inequality must hold for all elements in \(B_{e}(y)\). Thus, \(B_{e}(y) \subset B_{d}(x) \subset U\), giving us \(B_{e}(y) \subset U\), which is what we wanted.</p>
			<p id="text">There is a definition that will tie all of these concepts together for us.</p>
			<hr>
			<p id="text">Every open set, \(U\), of a space \(\mathbb{X}\), where space \(\mathbb{X}\) is fashioned with a metric, is a union of epsilon balls.</p>
